This is an effort to roll up the various backup scripts I have written over the years.<br>

Sad I need to write my own scripts for something so common as making backups, but some solutions I found lacked the control I needed, or worse, I would get everything working, and the author of the script would make a breaking change and I would need to waste way too much time reworking and retesting the solution. At some point I gave up a wrote my own.<br>

Not too much here, as this is mostly a wrapper around common commands like rsync and tar, and some simple job control and logging code.<br>
